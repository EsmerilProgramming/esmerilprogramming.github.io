    <p>Hi all, '0110100001100010' this is hb (happy birthday)</p>
    <p>So, in 2012 I started to learn asm but nowadays I remember nothing :p</p>
    <p>One thing I did was translate birth dates to binary in almost 25 seconds in mind (yup, I have witnesses). Ok is not a great deal :/
       But now to try to consolidate a bit more ( maybe more months ) i decide to try to push some asm code just to feel like 'I did something with assembly'
       (is a shit, but I did it!)
    </p>

    <p>Then basically we have to get one date (or whatever) as input and print the output as binary using assembly language for x86_64 arch</p>

    <p>It's not my focus to be an asm programmer (maybe)</p>
